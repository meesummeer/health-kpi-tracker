# Health Business KPI Tracker

A modern Streamlit dashboard for health businesses and clinics to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), financials, patient flow, and operational trends.

Built as part of my professional portfolio at CyberHealth Solutions, this dashboard showcases how clinics can use data-driven insights to make better business and clinical decisions. All data is demo/mock for portfolio purposes.
